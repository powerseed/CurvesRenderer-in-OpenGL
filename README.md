### This program allows user to draw BÃ©zier, Catmull-Rom, and (uniform) B-splines curves. Pressing the space bar will change the type of curve being drawn. 
### Clicking on the display window will add control points onto it, and drawing the control points can adjust the curve.

# Q2.cpp
![alt text](https://github.com/powerseed/CurvesRenderer-in-OpenGL/blob/master/screenshotForQ2.png "Logo Title Text 1")
### This program renders a shape formed by curves based on an `.txt` file, in which the control points are defined.
